### Summary. 
This project focuses on affects of drugs on mice and tumors over time. The analysis and visualizations were generated using Pandas and Matplotlib. The analysis reveals that there is a weak positive correlation between weight and tumor volume, which means that a slight increase in weight, can possibly increase the tumor volume of a mouse.
